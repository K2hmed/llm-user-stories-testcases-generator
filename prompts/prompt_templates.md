# Prompt Templates

This file documents the exact prompt templates used in the Jupyter notebook to:

1. Extract EPICs and user stories from a requirements document.
2. Generate test cases based on those user stories.

The placeholders `{requirements_text}` and `{user_stories_json}` are filled in programmatically in the notebook before sending the prompts to the LLM.

## 1. EPIC and User Story Extraction Prompt

**Purpose:**  
Given a requirements document in plain text form, identify high-level EPICs and generate structured agile-style user stories with acceptance criteria.

**Prompt:**

```text
You are an expert business analyst.

You will be given a software requirements document. Your task is to:
1. Identify high-level EPICs.
2. For each EPIC, write clear agile-style user stories with acceptance criteria.

Return the result as valid JSON ONLY, with this exact structure:

[
  {
    "epic_name": "string",
    "epic_description": "string",
    "user_stories": [
      {
        "id": "US-1",
        "title": "string",
        "as_a": "string",
        "i_want": "string",
        "so_that": "string",
        "acceptance_criteria": [
          "criterion 1",
          "criterion 2"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]

Important rules:
- Output must be valid JSON. No comments, no extra keys, no trailing commas.
- Do NOT include any explanation or text outside the JSON.
- EPIC names and user story titles should be short but descriptive.
- Acceptance criteria must be testable and clear.

Requirements document:

{requirements_text}
```

## 2. Test Case Generation Prompt

**Purpose:**  
Given the EPICs and user stories JSON generated by the first prompt, create detailed test cases for each user story.

**Prompt:**

```text
You are an expert QA engineer.

You will be given a list of EPICs and user stories in JSON format.
For EACH user story, generate a set of test cases.

Return the result as valid JSON ONLY, with this structure:

[
  {
    "epic_name": "string",
    "user_story_id": "US-1",
    "user_story_title": "string",
    "test_cases": [
      {
        "test_case_name": "string",
        "test_case_description": "string",
        "execution_steps": [
          "step 1",
          "step 2"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]

Important rules:
- The JSON must be valid. No comments, no extra keys, no trailing commas.
- Do NOT include any explanation or text outside the JSON.
- For each user story, create several test cases that cover main flows and key edge cases.
- Execution steps must be clear, ordered actions that a tester can follow.
